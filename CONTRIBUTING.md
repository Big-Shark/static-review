# Contributing

The following guidelines for contribution should be followed if you wish to submit a pull request.

## Getting Started

* Submit an [issue ticket](https://github.com/sjparkinson/static-review/issues) for your issue if one **does not** exist already

    * Describe the issue and include steps to reproduce if it's a bug

* If you are able and want to fix this, fork the repository on GitHub

## Making Changes

* In your forked repository, create a topic branch for your upcoming patch (e.g. `feature/autoplay` or `bugfix/ios-crash`)

    * Usually this is based on the master branch

    * Create a branch based on master, but please **do not** work directly on the `master` branch

* Make sure you stick to the coding style that is used already

* If possible, submit unit tests with your patch / new feature so it can be tested easily

* Ensure that nothing is broken by [running all the unit tests](https://github.com/sjparkinson/static-review/blob/development/README.md#unit-tests)

## Submitting Changes

1. Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository

2. Open a pull request to merge to the original repository

3. Lastly, please reference and update your original issue with the code changes
